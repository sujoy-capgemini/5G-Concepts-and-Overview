NG-RAN (Next Generation RAN)
•	Standard 5g RAN architecture
•	Uses gNB (Next Gen Node B ) split into –
1.	CU (Central Unit)
2.	DU(Distributed Unit)
•	Connect to the 5G core (5GC)

	AMF : Access and mobility management function that handle signaling,      registration,  connection and mobility management
	UPF : User Plane Function that manages user data traffic routing.
Types :
     NG-RAN two types :
1.	gNB  
	CU
	DU
2.	ng-eNB
CU :
	CU means Central Unit
	It handles no real function
	Manages :
                 RRC
                 Mobility Control
                 Session Management
	Connect to the 5G core via the NG interface.
DU :
	DU means that Distributed Unit
	Handel Real Time Function
	Manages :
    MAC :Medium Access Control
    RLC : Radio Link Control
    PHY : Physical Layer
	Connect to cu via the F1 interface.
