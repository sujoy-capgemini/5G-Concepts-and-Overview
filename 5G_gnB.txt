5G RAN - gNB overview:
Itâ€™s the 5G base station.
gNodeB (gNB) is the 5G base station that connects User Equipment (UE) to the 5G Core (5GC). It replaces the eNodeB from LTE and supports advanced features like:
â€¢	gNB means that (Next Generation Node B)
â€¢	it is the 5G base station. Means that it connect user Device (UE) to the 5G core Network.
â€¢	It is a part of 5G Radio Access Network(RAN)
â€¢	It have 3 part :
1.	CU (central unit)
2.	DU (distribute unit)
3.	RU (radio unit)
ðŸ“± Real-Time Example:
Suppose I am in Kolkata and I used a 5G smartphone and I wanted to watching 4k video then my smartphone that time this gNB work like:
1.	My phone (UE) send a request Nearest 5GTower. This tower is gNB
2.	Then (RU) also receive the request and convert the request to digital data.
3.	DU also real-time work like error checking and distribute the data.
4.	CU also handle the session management and forward the request to the 5G core Network.
The video Data fetched the internet and passed by to like:
 CU -> DU -> RU
