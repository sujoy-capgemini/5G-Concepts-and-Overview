5G is the fifth generation of wireless cellular technology offering faster data speed lower latency(delay).

Why Need :
    1.Higher speed
    2.Ultra Low Letency
    3.Massive Device Connectivity
    4.Enargy Eficent
    5.Network Slicing
    6.Bimforming technology.


Why Need :
1.	Higher Speed :  up to 300mbps extend 10Gbps
2.	Ultra Low latency : LTE 300-500ms but 5G 1ms
3.	Massive Device Connectivity : LTE support 1000 of device km squre but 5g support 1 million device km square.
4.	Energy Efficiency
5.	Network Slicing :virtual network of same physical machine.
