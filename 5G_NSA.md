5G Deployment Options 
Two main types of 5G deployment:
1.	NSA – Non-Standalone 5G
2.	SA – Standalone 5G
NSA (Non Standalone 5G Architecture):
•	Uses 4G and 5G together.
•	4G LTE handles control signals
•	5G is used mainly for faster data.
•	Lower Cost
•	Quick two easy launch
•	Good speed improvement
SA(Standalone 5G Architecture): 
•	Fully 5G : 5G radio+5G core Network.
•	No need for 4G support
•	Support advanced features. Like – Network slicing, massive IoT
