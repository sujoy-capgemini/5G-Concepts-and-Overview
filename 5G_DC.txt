Dual Connectivity (DC) in 5G networks
Dual Connectivity allows a User Equipment (UE) (like a smartphone) to connect to two different base stations at the same time:
â€¢	One is the Master Node (MN).
â€¢	The other is the Secondary Node (SN).
This setup improves:
â€¢	Data throughput
â€¢	Network reliability
â€¢	Mobility performance

ðŸ§± Types of Dual Connectivity in 5G
1. EN-DC (E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity)
â€¢	Master Node: LTE eNB
â€¢	Secondary Node: 5G gNB
â€¢	Used in 5G NSA (Non-Standalone) deployments.

2. NE-DC (NR-E-UTRA Dual Connectivity)
â€¢	Master Node: 5G gNB
â€¢	Secondary Node: LTE eNB
â€¢	Used in 5G SA (Standalone) with LTE fallback.

3. NR-DC (NR-NR Dual Connectivity)
â€¢	Master Node: 5G gNB
â€¢	Secondary Node: Another 5G gNB
â€¢	Used in pure 5G deployments.
